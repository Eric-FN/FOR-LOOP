📝 **Dynamic HTML Element Creator**
This project dynamically creates HTML elements based on an array of objects and appends them to the DOM. It showcases how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript,
creating elements with specific tags and texts and displaying them within a container.

🛠 **Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS (with custom properties and Google Fonts)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

📁 **Project Structure:**
- **index.html**: The main HTML file where the structure of the webpage and the container for the dynamically created elements is defined.
- **css/style.css**: Contains styles for the page layout, buttons, and form fields, using CSS variables for theming and responsive design.
- **js/main.js**: Contains JavaScript logic to:
    - Create HTML elements based on an array of objects
    - Dynamically append the created elements to a container in the DOM
    - Use `createElement` and `createTextNode` to generate content

⚡ **Features:**
- Dynamically generates and displays elements of different tags (p, div, footer, section).
- Each element has a specific text defined in an array.
- Simple form interface with a stylish, responsive layout using custom CSS and Google Fonts.

🚀 **How to Run:**
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. The page will display a list of dynamically generated HTML elements based on the array defined in the JavaScript file.

Perfect for practicing DOM manipulation and understanding the use of JavaScript for creating dynamic content. 💻📑
